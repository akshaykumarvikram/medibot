# Medibot: AI Assisted biomedical Literatue
## Winner of IBM - MobileMonday- API first hackathon, NYC.
Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is an approach to medical practice intended to optimize decision-making by emphasizing the use of evidence from well-designed and well-conducted research. This provides provides with a method to use critically appraised and scientifically proven evidence for delivering quality health care to a specific population.

one of the most import step in EBM in **searching for evidence**. I,e. Finding the Biomedical Literature/articles to answer the clinical quentions. But, unfortunately this is not a simple straight forwards search. The following video summerizes the existing practice.

Unfortunately, this is a very time consuming process. According to a 2014 study, although 76% of the nurse practitioner agree that EBM should be part of their practive, more that 50% them agree that they couldnt apply it effectively because it was a bit difficult and time consuming. 

So, Addressing this problem we have decided to add a layer of AI on to the traditional PubMed website, to automate the processes of finding the appropriate medical terms(MeSH) terms, and building an optimized query. This is how our system works.
