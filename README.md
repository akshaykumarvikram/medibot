# Medibot: AI Assisted biomedical Literatue

Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is an approach to medical practice intended to optimize decision-making by emphasizing the use of evidence from well-designed and well-conducted research. Although all medicine based on science has some degree of empirical support, EBM goes further, classifying evidence by its epistemologic strength and requiring that only the strongest types (coming from meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and randomized controlled trials) can yield strong recommendations.

So, one of the most import step in EBM in **searching for evidence**. I,e. Finding the Biomedical Literature/articles to answer the clinical quentions. But, unfortunately this is not a simple straight forwards search. The following video summerizes the existing practice.
